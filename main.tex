    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    In Module 1 you committed to becoming a better interpersonal communicator by
      focusing on improving two interpersonal communication skills. In each
      subsequent module, we are checking in to see how those efforts are
      proceeding based on your practice sessions. In this module, you will
      report on how your practice has progressed so far.\\%

    You should spend approximately 4 hours on this assignment.%

  \section*{Instructions}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item How did your interpersonal skills improve over the course of the
        class?
      \item Of the skills you chose to work on, which one improved the most?
        Which one improved the least? Why?
      \item Which skill was the hardest to improve? Which was the easiest?
      \item Which outside influences (e.g., family, work, etc.) interfered with
        your ability to improve your skills? Which influences helped?
      \item At which point in the course do you feel you turned a corner toward
        becoming your ``real you'', as Sam does in the video clip? How did it
        happen? If you do not feel you ever turned a corner, why not?
      \item What skills will you continue to work on improving once the class
        is over? How will you keep yourself motivated to improve those skills
        when you are no longer required to report your efforts to the class?
    \end{enumerate}
