    \textbf{Overview}\\%
    In Module 1 you committed to becoming a better interpersonal communicator by
      focusing on improving two interpersonal communication skills. In each
      subsequent module, we are checking in to see how those efforts are
      proceeding based on your practice sessions. In this module, you will
      report on how your practice has progressed so far.\\%

    You should spend approximately 4 hours on this assignment.%

  \section*{Instructions}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item How did your interpersonal skills improve over the course of the
        class?
      \item Of the skills you chose to work on, which one improved the most?
        Which one improved the least? Why?
      \item Which skill was the hardest to improve? Which was the easiest?
      \item Which outside influences (e.g., family, work, etc.) interfered with
        your ability to improve your skills? Which influences helped?
      \item At which point in the course do you feel you turned a corner toward
        becoming your ``real you'', as Sam does in the video clip? How did it
        happen? If you do not feel you ever turned a corner, why not?
      \item What skills will you continue to work on improving once the class
        is over? How will you keep yourself motivated to improve those skills
        when you are no longer required to report your efforts to the class?
    \end{enumerate}

  \newpage
  \section{Initial Post}
    It has been a great class! Too bad it was so short, I feel like I barely
      got to know anyone here!

    \subsection{How My Skills Have Improved Over the Class}
      Placeholder.


    \subsection{Skill Progress}
      I feel like it is not all that possible to be 100\% proficient in
        \textit{every} interpersonal communication skill (or even a single
        one of them), as there are \textbf{always} ways to improve or increase
        one's understanding of another type of person.
      \subsubsection{Skill With Most Improvement}
        Placeholder.
      \subsubsection{Skill With Least Improvement}
        As I will discuss later in this discussion post, I feel my attention to
          the current ``\textit{psychological context}'' is still the skill
          I am most suffering with.


    \subsection{Working on These Skills}
      \subsubsection{The Hardest Skill To Improve}
        The hardest skill to improve by far was the understanding of the current
          ``psychological context'', as stated by one of our course texts
          \parencite{noauthor_communication_2013}.
      \subsubsection{The Easist Skill To Improve}
        The easiest skill for me to improve over this course would have to be
          that of \textit{empathy}. I am now much more affected by the
          situations described to me by others after having experienced many
          low points in my last semester here.
      \subsubsection{Outside Influences Affecting The Use of Certain Skills}
        \paragraph{The Coronavirus Pandemic}
          The obvious outside influence affecting my ability to practice certain
            skills would have to be the Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemic. While
            I was \textit{always} in online school and in an essential business
            function, COVID-19 did not affect my work or school and in fact
            resulted in me getting \textbf{even more} work hours since February
            of this year.

          The main way in which the Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemic affected
            the practice of utilizing interpersonal communication sills was
            due to the fact that we all are wearing masks when out in public,
            making the nonverbal communication skills we are all used to
            analyzing for a persons ``true emotions'' non-existent.


    \subsection{Conclusion}
      \subsection{When did I ``Turn a Corner''}
