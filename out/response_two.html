    style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">I choose an effective delivery
    method of communication and active listening to improve upon because I was not chosen for a promotion at work. I was
    not sure of the reason, but I knew I had some communication issues. I came into this class with an open mind and
    with the intention of figuring out what I needed to correct because I was not getting any feedback from anyone.
    Needless to say, I have received my answer.</span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span
    style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; border: none windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">I
    improved with listening, but I did not improve with delivery. This exercise and class are much harder than I
    thought. I have such bad habits. My mother had seven children, and she had to yell to make sure we were listening. I
    grew up thinking that if you did not do what I wanted you to do then it was because you did not hear me, so I must
    speak louder. That is not the case. How my mother communicated with her children was totally different how she
    communicated at work. People loved her. They loved being around her, working with her, talking to her, and receiving
    advice from her. She was able to change the way she communicated from home to work, and her communication never
    suffered. I do not think I learned that as well as she did, but I am willing to change. My work is sad being a
    nurse, and I want to focus on my improvement of communication skills. I do not communicate with coworkers as much as
    family, and family is the way I practice my communication skills because I get good feedback right away. I got
    interference from family that do not want to communicate by facetime or video chat and phone because they look or
    feel bad. I grew up with them, so I know exactly how bad they look, and I felt like it was just an excuse. The
    pushback is hard to handle, but I know I need to listen to them because there may be an underlining issue at hand
    that I am not aware of. </span></p>
<p style="margin: 0in 0in 8pt; line-height: 107%; font-size: 11pt; font-family: Calibri, sans-serif;"><span
    style="font-size: 12.0pt; line-height: 107%; font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif; border: none windowtext 1.0pt; padding: 0in;">I
    will continue to work on all the communication skills I am lacking and completing graduate school and receiving a
    promotion will be my motivation. I want my son to communicate well with others in preschool and in the future so
    that he can go further in life than I have.</span></p>
