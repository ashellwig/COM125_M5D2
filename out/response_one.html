<p dir="ltr">Although I wouldn&rsquo;t say I hadn&rsquo;t improved in it at all, I&rsquo;d say that the most challenging
  skill to improve was the skill of <strong>asserting myself</strong>. The assignments in this course made me more aware
  of the skill itself and some ways I could improve it in feedback that was much more helpful and I think more engaging
  than reading off of a Helpline article. On the other hand I think my ability to <strong>be an engaged
    listener</strong> had drastically improved due to the same causes of reading feedback and reading some of the other
  content off this course&rsquo;s pages.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of course the hardest challenge was COVID-19. It made finding people to interact with much more difficult
  and I often found myself trying to create meaningful encounters so I could practice assertion and engagement for the
  practice log. Some of the encounters that helped though were simple phone calls concerning my upcoming graduation, my
  transfer, calls with friends and the occasional meetings with some other friends and family
  friends.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Like everyone else during this time I feel like we&rsquo;ve all made personal breakthroughs. I feel like
  for me a large part of my younger life, especially my teens which I&rsquo;m barely out of, deals with these
  breakthroughs and the aftermaths of trying to figure out why they occurred, what they mean, and how to apply them. For
  lack of a better word: I&rsquo;m turning corners all the time. Ironically even though everyone says I&rsquo;m good at
  it, I usually don&rsquo;t feel like I&rsquo;m turning corners in academics in general, like during middle school then
  high school then college. I think it&rsquo;s because of how crazy some of my academic career has been, mainly the
  political/social corners that has turned to the point where a lot of it seems &ldquo;dulled&rdquo;. But, it&rsquo;s
  not as dulled enough where I know when to celebrate the little things, I guess.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">I feel like it&rsquo;s enough to be motivated to continue to improve these interpersonal communication
  skills because I&rsquo;d want to improve the way I communicate to the rest of the world. Obviously there&rsquo;s
  economic factors to consider too like job interviews, then the job itself, then everyone else you meet in the future,
  you&rsquo;d want to get along well with them too so that&rsquo;s a huge motivator, but for myself I&rsquo;d like to
  just be, or continue to be, a good communicator.&nbsp;<strong></strong></p>
<p dir="ltr">Even though it was for a brief time, I&rsquo;d say that this class actually did help! Thank you! :)</p>
