<p class="noindent">It has been a great class! Too bad it was so short, I feel like I barely got to know anyone here!
</p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>How My Skills Have Improved Over the Class</h4>
<p class="noindent">I believe my skills have improved over the class due to the fact that I am now <span
    class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">far </span>more conscience of how my thoughts, feelings, stories, and situations which I
  discuss in public affect other people. I am also more aware of how focusing attention on the subject of the
  conversation is far more important than relating the situation being discussed back to myself and that silence can be
  used in a positive way.</p>
<p class="noindent"></p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Skill Progress</h4>
<p class="noindent">I feel like it is not all that possible to be 100% proficient in <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">every
  </span>interpersonal communication skill (or even a single one of them), as there are <span
    class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">always </span>ways to improve or increase one&rsquo;s understanding of another type of
  person.</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Skill With Most Improvement</h5>
<p class="noindent">The interpersonal communication skill I had been working on with the most improvement had to have
  been empathy, as I will discuss later in my post with the subject of being the &ldquo;easiest&rdquo; (still not easy)
  interpersonal communication skill to work on.</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Skill With Least Improvement</h5>
<p class="noindent">As I will discuss later in this discussion post, I feel my attention to the current &ldquo;<span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">psychological context</span>&rdquo; is still the skill I am most suffering with.</p>
<p class="noindent"></p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Working on These Skills</h4>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>The Hardest Skill To Improve</h5>
<p class="noindent">The hardest skill to improve by far was the understanding of the current &ldquo;psychological
  context&rdquo;, as stated by one of our course texts (<span
    class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">noauthor_communication_2013</span>).</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>The Easiest Skill To Improve</h5>
<p class="noindent">The easiest skill for me to improve over this course would have to be that of <span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">empathy</span>. I am now much more affected by the situations described to me by others
  after having experienced many low points in my last semester here.</p>
<h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Outside Influences Affecting The Use of Certain Skills</h5>
<p class="noindent"><span class="paragraphHead"><a rel="noopener"></a><span class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">The Coronavirus
      Pandemic</span></span> The obvious outside influence affecting my ability to practice certain skills would have to
  be the Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemic. While I was <span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">always </span>in online school and in
  an essential business function, COVID-19 did not affect my work or school and in fact resulted in me getting <span
    class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">even more</span> work hours since February of this year.</p>
<p class="noindent">The main way in which the Coronavirus COVID-19 Pandemic affected the practice of utilizing
  interpersonal communication sills was due to the fact that we all are wearing masks when out in public, making the
  nonverbal communication skills we are all used to analyzing for a persons &ldquo;true emotions&rdquo; non-existent.
</p>
<p class="noindent"></p>
<h4 class="subsectionHead"><a rel="noopener"></a>Conclusion</h4>
<p class="noindent">I believe that I &ldquo;turned a corner&rdquo; on where I view myself and where I would rather be in
  terms of interpersonal communication skills when we discussed the subject of &ldquo;<span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">listening</span>&rdquo;. This is when I noticed I was more of an &ldquo;<span
    class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Action Oriented Listener</span>&rdquo; or a &ldquo;<span class="ptmri8t-x-x-120">Time
    Oriented Listener</span>&rdquo;. My ex-girlfriend (turned roommate as of recently) expressed how that was one of the
  main things that gave her issues during our five-year long relationship, but was <span class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">not
  </span>the thing that ended it. Nevertheless, I felt the need to work on my interpersonal communication skills as well
  as show her the same things I am working on in order for us both to communicate with one another in a more efficient
  way to improve both our current and any future relationships we have.</p>
