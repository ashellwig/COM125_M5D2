<p>I, too, am working on confidence! I wish you the best of luck because it is not all that easy to put yourself out
  there without knowing the outcome of how others will view you afterwards!</p>
<p>I wanted to ask about the situational differences you noticed in other's understanding of your nonverbal
  communication. You said it depended on the situation, but I was wondering: does it depend more on the situation or the
  status of the relationship between the other person and oneself? I had known people in the past where no matter the
  situation, even after repeat occurrences, could simply <em>not</em> get nonverbal communication cues I gave off! Is
  this similar in your experience, or are the same people more understanding of your nonverbal communication cues in
  differing scenarios?</p>

<p>I am working on nonverbal communication and confidence. Since last module, I actually worked on my two skills three
  times yesterday (11/23/2020). I worked on these skills at work with some success and failure. I was able to exhibit
  nonverbal communication when communicating at work; I just focused on my body language and speed of talking as well as
  tone of voice. However, confidence was something I struggled with even though I told myself positive statements and
  focused on body language to improve my confidence. I don&rsquo;t have a huge success story, but something happened
  that did not go well while working on these skills. I had to deliver some negative news to a parent, and ended feeling
  super insecure and not confident at all. I think this contributed to their negative response.</p>
<p><br />I think people misinterpret my non-verbals quite frequently when I am communicating. So I can&rsquo;t really
  say if they always do or don&rsquo;t give away too much, it kind of just depends on the situation and the person. This
  is an area I need to work on since my non-verbal signals do not always match how I am feeling, or they exaggerate how
  I am really feeling. A time body language was telling a different story, was when I was working with a client. I asked
  the client if they were feeling okay, and they said yes. However, their tone of voice sounded sad, their shoulders
  were slumped, their head was down, and they didn&rsquo;t want to really talk to me.</p>
