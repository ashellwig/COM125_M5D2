<p>Lovely and excellently thorough post, Kristyna! My attention was caught by where you began to talk about how you try
  to keep your body language in check in order not to give yourself away too much during informal and casual
  conversation. I feel that those individuals with perhaps a lot of experience in dealing with people and reading body
  language would be able to detect when someone else is attempting to consciously adjust their own body language. Would
  you say that you have notice this in anyone else? When I have spoken to someone about a situation in which they may
  have done something wrong or are trying to hide something, what that person may feel is a ``calm collected exterior''
  could come off to the other person as anxious or antsy. Though there are many people I have interacted with that are
  just as stoic as the day is long!<br /><br />&lt;&lt;&lt; Replied to post below &gt;&gt;&gt;<br />Authored by:

  class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">The two interpersonal
    communication skills that I&rsquo;m working on are&nbsp;assertive self-expression, and being able to adapt my
    messages to account for the unique perspective of the other person.&nbsp;</span></p>

  class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I took the chance to
    practice my assertive self-expression skill with my mom. She asked me to help her organize her house and get her
    papers in order; however, it was not a good day for me, and I did not think that I would do the best I could. I used
    &ldquo;I&rdquo; statements to get my message across, and informed her that I would be of more help another day. She
    understood this, and we agreed upon another time. This allowed me to not only be more open with myself, but with my
    family. I made sure to be honest with myself about how I was feeling, and to be more assertive with people, so I
    wouldn't end up troubling the other person and myself. I practiced adapting my messages while I was at work on
    Sunday. A regular came in and sparked up a conversation with me. I had not really spoken a ton with him before, so I
    took this opportunity to do so. When I was speaking with him, I inquired about his past and worked from the
    information I got. This allowed me to hone in my abilities on adapting my messages, and I got to know more about
    him, which resulted in a better and deeper conversation. Pretty much every time I practiced my skills, they were a
    success. Of course, some days were better than others, but overall, there wasn&rsquo;t really a day that was highly
    unsuccessful. Every day I am able to get better at working on my interpersonal communication, and each time I can
    learn from my conversations, and what I did right versus what I need to improve on.&nbsp;</span></p>

  class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 12pt; font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;">I, personally, don&rsquo;t
    think my non-verbals give too much away when I am communicating. I am pretty good at keeping myself in check with my
    body language, and displaying that I am engaged in the conversation. I will say though, that a lot of the time when
    I am conversing with others, I tend to cross my arms. This is not because I am annoyed or disinterested, it is just
    a comfortable position for me, and one I resort to. However, this could be received negatively by the person I am
    having a conversation with, and make me come across as rude. I could definitely work on this more, so my non-verbals
    don&rsquo;t say one thing, when I am actually feeling the opposite. One example of this was when I was speaking with
    my friend, I crossed my arms, but soon after I noticed a shift in his attitude. I realized that he probably got the
    impression that I was annoyed, angry, not interested in the conversation, or somewhere in between. I immediately
    changed my body language to show that I was in fact engrossed in the conversation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
