    \begin{quotation}
      Although I wouldn’t say I hadn’t improved in it at all, I’d say that the
        most challenging skill to improve was the skill of asserting myself.
        The assignments in this course made me more aware of the skill itself
        and some ways I could improve it in feedback that was much more helpful
        and I think more engaging than reading off of a Helpline article. On the
        other hand I think my ability to be an engaged listener had drastically
        improved due to the same causes of reading feedback and reading some of
        the other content off this course’s pages.

      Of course the hardest challenge was COVID-19. It made finding people to
        interact with much more difficult and I often found myself trying to
        create meaningful encounters so I could practice assertion and
        engagement for the practice log. Some of the encounters that helped
        though were simple phone calls concerning my upcoming graduation, my
        transfer, calls with friends and the occasional meetings with some other
        friends and family friends.
