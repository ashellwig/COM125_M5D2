    I choose an effective delivery method of communication and active listening
      to improve upon because I was not chosen for a promotion at work. I was
      not sure of the reason, but I knew I had some communication issues. I came
      into this class with an open mind and with the intention of figuring out
      what I needed to correct because I was not getting any feedback from
      anyone. Needless to say, I have received my answer.

    [\ldots]

    I will continue to work on all the communication skills I am lacking and
      completing graduate school and receiving a promotion will be my
      motivation. I want my son to communicate well with others in preschool
      and in the future so that he can go further in life than I have.
